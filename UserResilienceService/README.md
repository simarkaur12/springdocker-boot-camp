# 8. Resilience4j - Circuit breaker mechanism.

This Spring Boot application demonstrates how to use Resilience4j for resilience and fault tolerance in microservices
architecture.

## Overview

The application consists of a `UserController` class that uses Resilience4j's `@CircuitBreaker` annotation to handle
failures when calling a remote service to retrieve user orders. The `UserController` class also includes a fallback method
to provide default orders when the circuit is open.

| [prefix].[serviceName].waitDurationInOpenState                      | String  | Specifies the duration for which the circuit breaker should stay in the open state before transitioning to the half-open state.                                                              | ex: 5s, indicating that the circuit breaker will stay open for 5 seconds before transitioning to the half-open state.                                                                          |

## Usage

- Access the application at http://localhost:1111/user/orders to retrieve user orders.
- Simulate failures by stopping the remote service or causing it to return errors, and observe how Resilience4j handles the failures.
