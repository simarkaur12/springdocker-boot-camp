# 11. Zuul Proxy Server Application

This is a Spring Boot application that demonstrates the use of Zuul Proxy for routing and filtering requests to backend
services. It acts as a gateway that sits between client requests and your backend services.

## Configuration

The application can be configured using the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.
Here are some key configurations:

| Key                     | Description                                                               |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| server.port             | The port on which the application runs.                                   |
| zuul.routes.[name].path | The path pattern to match for routing.                                    |
| zuul.routes.[name].url  | The URL of the backend service to which the requests should be forwarded. |
